            <p>
               Kappa Kappa Psi is more than a club or a society; it's a brotherhood. Like any relationship, building and maintaining the bond between brothers is no small task, which is where the brotherhood committee comes into play. From simple de-stressing exercises during finals week to team building activities covering communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution, the brotherhood committee organizes a variety of events ranging from post-meeting dinners to weekend-long retreats. Strong relationships are key to Iota Pi's success as a chapter, and brotherhood is critical to building those relationships and moving the chapter forward.

            "Music is a world within itself, with a language we all understand." It plays a vital role in all of our lives and we strive to get better each day through practice and being involved in many different ensembles.  The purpose of the music committee is to promote music and musicianship within the community, the brotherhood, and the Cal Poly bands. <br/>
                           We promote music with events such as: musical petting zoos, elementary school visits, music buddies, instrumental swaps, and creating high school music leadership workshops. Through these events we outreach to the community hoping that it will inspire even just one person to play music. Alex Jacobius, brother of Iota Pi and music major, started to play trombone after having tried one in a musical petting zoo. This proves that giving kids the opportunity to play an instrument can be monumental in their development. The music committee sees the importance of music in people's lives and strives to keep music alive within schools and communities.
